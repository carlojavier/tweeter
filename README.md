# TWEETER!!

Tweeter is a single-page Twitter clone that exhibits an understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals. The web app replicates the root functionalities of Twitter and does so by amplifying the HTML/CSS markup with the use of jQuery, AJAX, and MongoDB. The tweets themselves are built via HTML+CSS, but are generated dynamically through AJAX and jQuery.

## THE GOAL

## FINAL PRODUCT
